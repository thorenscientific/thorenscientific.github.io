A Pre-Post Pox-Eclipse Reading / Watch List
===========================================

Most of this site is intended to be pure science, all the time, no politics or opinions. This page is the exception. I think I can justify this by linking a couple of things:
Science isn't just a job, hobby, or obsession - it's pervaded my life since my earliest memories. And along the way, quite a few notable works of science fact and fiction, history and prediction, and occasional other random work, have burned themselves into my consciousness. They've echoed and resonated across the decades, triggering memories at both completely predictable and completely random moments.  

`Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome <https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_max_beyond_thunderdome>`_
What's with the name of this page?? It's paraphrased from a line in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. This is an epic 1985 movie that I probably wore out the VHS tape from watching it so many times. Highly quotable. I don't think this is a spoiler - Some years ago I had picked up the book `Riddley Walker by Russel Hoban <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776573.Riddley_Walker>`_. It is NOT an easy read just due to the language (pick it up and give it a shot, you'll see what I mean.) I still haven't finished it, my goal is to read it aloud to help with the language barrier and record it for fun. But... in the 2/3 of the book that I did get though, I kept thinking, "this story line, and some of these crazy characters sure sound familiar". Yup, freakin' Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Here's a `Reddit thread on the topic <https://www.reddit.com/r/MadMax/comments/w9hiid/a_theory_about_beyond_thunderdome/>`_ and it's even mentioned in the `Wikipedia entry  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome#Critical_response>`_.  

`The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4711854-the-machine-stops>`_  
Since this story helped trigger this page in the first place. The Machine Stops is a sci-fi short story from... **1906**! An amazing story, you can read it in less than an hour, just give it a shot. Maybe more commentary later.

`A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything>`_ For this electrical engineer, a fantastic book for a light dusting of a bunch of subjects I would not normally study.

`The Terminator <https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator>`_  
Wow, all of this artificial intelligence stuff is great, right! Not so fast. I watched The Terminator when I was probably 12 years old, way too young for such an intense movie, and as a result it's shaped my thinking on technology, well, for nearly 80% of my life. Whenever I see people getting excited about a bright AI driven future, I just think "Dude, have you NOT seen The Terminator?" Occasionally you'll hear the term "`Skynet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)>`_". Yup, from The Terminator. Also spoiler alert if you haven't seen it, the `Tech Noir scene <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XWeDx1oSAs>`_ is probably one of the most brilliant scenes in any action movie, ever.
And for the sake of completeness, here's a compilation of music from `Tahnee Cain and the Tryanglz - The Tech Noir Album <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXKdis0Vhjk>`_, a band basically invented for the movie. Dripping with 1980s nostalgia.

**The Holy Trinity of Dystopian Fiction:**

1. `1984 by George Orwell <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61439040-1984>`_ (Dude, it's supposed to be a warning, not an instruction manual...)
2. `Brave New World by Aldous Huxley <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World>`_
3. `Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451>`_

`We by Yevgeny Zamyatin <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76171.We>`_ (Since we're on Orwell...) Translated from Russian. I remember it being a joy to listen to. Clearly influenced Orwell. Remember to vote!

`The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76778.The_Martian_Chronicles>`_ (Since we're on Bradbury...)  

`Fantastic Tales of Ray Bradbury <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394756.Fantastic_Tales_of_Ray_Bradbury>`_  
I listened to the audiobook with introduction read by the author, and commentary on a few of the stories. Inspirational - he's got a fantastic work ethic. And the intro to "A Sound of Thunder", a classic time travel story, is hilarious.


`Black Mirror <https://black-mirror.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Mirror_Wiki>`_  
Enough said. We are living most episodes, to some degree.  

`The Stand by Stephen King <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149267.The_Stand>`_  
Mostly a fictional work, but with some "biology" thrown into the mix. Stephen King can be polarizing. Is it "Literature", or pulp? My fifth grade teacher read the class stories from `Night Shift <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10628.Night_Shift>`_, and many of those stories are burned into my memory in their own right. But we're talking about The Stand. I probably read it when I was 15, plus or minus a couple of years. I'm not a fast reader and it's a long book, so it probably spanned a couple of (pre-smartphone) road trips. It was a pretty good book with quite a few intertwined stories, and I'd find myself thinking about them over the years. The `1994 TV series <https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_stand>`_ is also on my re-watch list. Well, fast forward to 2020, stupid COVID. Almost immediately scenes from The Stand started popping up in my mind, and then there's this NPR interview with Terry Gross: `Stephen King Is Sorry You Feel Like You're Stuck In A Stephen King Novel <https://www.npr.org/transcripts/829298135>`_! I immediately put The Stand back on my re-read list. I've switched to audio books, which I listen to almost exclusively while trail running, and eventually gave it a listen. WOW! Not only was it a great read (well, listen), I was surprised at how many passages I literally remembered verbatim, like my brain remembering lines a few seconds before they were read aloud. Not disappointed.

And here's a fun Twitter thread on Stephen's response to headlines like `“Stephen King and his wife donate $1.25M to New England Historic Genealogical Society.” <https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1101115032308461568>`_.

`The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich>`_
